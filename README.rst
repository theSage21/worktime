WorkTimeThing
========

Simple task time tracker::

    python -m worktime b issue-10
    python -m worktime begin issue-10
    python -m worktime e issue-10
    python -m worktime end issue-10
    python -m worktime  # shows a summary


Then get summaries in Jira work log format so that you don't have to worry about those any longer.
